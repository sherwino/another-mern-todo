# Another Basic To-Do App
I know, I know, here we go with another basic CRUD application that does almost nothing, but I was doing it as a little refresher for some of the things about react that I may or may not have forgotten. 

Below is a plethora of information provided to me by the React team.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you want to know more about what they provide, and how to use the tools to perform most of the common tasks checkout the documentation [here](./docs/createReactApp.md).
